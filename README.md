# Drone Kubernetes

Drone plugin to create/update Kubernetes resources.

It is inspired by [vallard](https://github.com/vallard) and his plugin [drone-kube](https://github.com/vallard/drone-kube).

It uses the latest k8s go api, so it is intened to use on Kubernetes 1.9+. I can't guarantee it will work for previous versions.

## Usage
